    <p>Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end. This allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail. Adults have dark stripes on the tail. It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth.</p>
